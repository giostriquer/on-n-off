# PROVIDERS.md — how each agent stores what on-n-off reads and writes

One section per provider: home folder, CLI, plugin layout, skills, MCP config, and what the app may
mutate. Adapters live in `src-tauri/src/{claude,codex,antigravity,cursor}.rs`; keep provider quirks
there behind `AgentAdapter`. Everything the app writes goes through `ConfigIo` (backup → atomic
replace → validate → rollback). Agent homes are real user data — see AGENTS.md "Data safety".

Legend: **verified** = observed on a real machine or in the provider's docs; **code** = what the
adapter assumes today (change the adapter and this file together).

## Common shape

- Home: `~/.<provider>` under `user_home()` — `ON_N_OFF_HOME` overrides the home for **all**
  providers (tests, QA fixtures). `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows, `$HOME` elsewhere.
- Plugin id: `<name>@<marketplace>`; `local` when there is no marketplace (`paths::plugin_id_parts`).
- Manifest lookup order for versions (`plugin_meta.rs`): `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `plugin.json`, then a version-looking
  folder name.
- MCP DTO: `enabled` is derived per provider (see below); the UI toggle calls
  `AgentAdapter::set_mcp_enabled`.
- Project scope: `project.rs` reads `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/` inside a project for skills
  and `.cursor/mcp.json` for project MCP.
- Local items (`item_install/`): on-n-off can copy individual skills (and, for Claude, subagents)
  out of a GitHub marketplace repository without the provider CLI. It downloads one
  `codeload.github.com` tarball, writes the item under `AgentAdapter::item_roots(scope)` (skills:
  `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills`;
  project scope: the first dir of `project_skill_dirs`; agents: `~/.claude/agents` /
  `.claude/agents`, Claude only), and records provenance (repo, ref, commit sha, plugin version,
  per-file sha256) in `~/.on-n-off/installed-items.json`. Item folders stay byte-identical to
  upstream — no sidecar files, no frontmatter edits — so "modified locally" is a pure hash
  comparison. Replacing or removing an item first copies it to
  `~/.on-n-off/backups/<provider>/items/`. Update checks call
  `api.github.com/repos/{o}/{r}/commits/{ref}` (sha only) and re-download the tarball only when
  the sha moved. Public repositories only. `item_update_status` also returns each item's
  `source` (owner/repo/ref), `pluginName`, `upstreamPath`, and an `upstreamUrl` pointing at the
  installed commit on github.com; the Skills screen shows managed rows as `from owner/repo`
  with that link, opened through the `open_url` command (github.com HTTPS links only, via
  `tauri-plugin-opener`).
- Item dependencies (`item_install/deps.rs`): skills name the sibling skills they drive only in
  prose — neither `SKILL.md` nor `plugin.json` has a dependency field — so `inspect_marketplace`
  scans every text file of each entry for the names (frontmatter name and folder/file name) of
  the other entries in the marketplace and reports `dependsOn` per entry with a confidence:
  **high** when the name is used like a command or identifier (`` `/N` ``, `` `N` ``, `/N` in
  prose, `Skill(N)`, a quoted `"N"` shortly after the word "skill", `skill: N`, `--skill N`, or a
  path into the sibling's folder such as `skills/…/N/` or `../N/`); **medium** when it appears in
  a phrase (`N skill`, `the N`, `run N`, `use N`). Names shorter than three characters are
  ignored, self-mentions are dropped, a same-plugin sibling wins over a same-named entry in
  another plugin, and the highest confidence wins per target. The picker auto-adds high
  confidence dependencies (transitively) when an entry is checked and only hints at medium ones;
  nothing is forced. Each entry also reports `externalRefs` (`../…` and foreign `skills/…` paths
  the local copy will not contain) and `usesPluginRoot` (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` appears), and each
  plugin reports `extras` (`commands`, `hooks`, `mcp` present in the plugin folder or manifest);
  the picker shows these as an advisory pointing at Install plugin. High confidence edges are
  recorded per installed item as `source.dependsOn` (`plugin/kind/path`) in
  `installed-items.json`; older files without the field still load. This is a heuristic tuned
  on real marketplaces, not a contract: expect false positives on generic names and misses on
  unusual phrasing.

## Claude (Claude Code)

| | |
|---|---|
| Home | `~/.claude` (+ `~/.claude.json` for MCP) |
| CLI | `claude` (`claude.cmd` via npm on Windows) — used for install/uninstall/update/toggle: `claude plugin <action> -s user <id>` |
| Plugins | `plugins/installed_plugins.json` is the truth (version 2, `installPath`, `version`); cache under `plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/`; marketplaces in `plugins/known_marketplaces.json` (+ `plugins/marketplaces/<name>/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) |
| Enable state | `settings.json` → `enabledPlugins { "<id>": bool }` |
| Skills | plugin `skills/`; user skills `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| MCP | `~/.claude.json` → `mcpServers`, disabled when `disabled: true` **or** listed in `disabledMcpServers`; app patches that file |
| Usage / Limits | transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (falls back to `~/projects`); OAuth token from macOS Keychain (`/usr/bin/security`) else `~/.claude/.credentials.json`; never written |
| Togglable | plugins (via CLI), user skills, MCP |

## Codex

| | |
|---|---|
| Home | `~/.codex`; shared skills also in `~/.agents/skills` |
| CLI | `codex` (npm) — install/uninstall through the CLI |
| Config | one file: `~/.codex/config.toml` — `[marketplaces.<name>]`, `[plugins."<name>@<mkt>"] enabled = bool`, `[[skills.config]] path/enabled`, `[mcp_servers.<id>] ... enabled = false` |
| Plugins | cache `plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<newest dir>`; marketplaces cloned under `.tmp/marketplaces/<name>` for git sources |
| Enable state | all in `config.toml`; app patches with `toml_edit` (`patch_toml_*`) |
| Skills | plugin `skills/`; user skills `~/.codex/skills` and `~/.agents/skills`; per-path enable rows in `[[skills.config]]` |
| Usage / Limits | transcripts under `~/.codex/sessions/**`; token + account id from `~/.codex/auth.json` (read-only) |
| Togglable | plugins, skills, MCP — all file patches |

## Antigravity (Gemini CLI family)

| | |
|---|---|
| Home | `~/.gemini`; CLI state in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/` |
| CLI | `agy` — Windows native installer puts it in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agy\bin` (verified) |
| Plugins | `antigravity-cli/plugins/*` (source `cli`) and `config/plugins/*` (source `config`); enablement merged from `antigravity-cli/{config,plugins,settings}.json` |
| Skills | `antigravity-cli/skills` (own frontmatter scanner) |
| MCP | `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` → `mcpServers`, `disabled: true` honoured; app patches that file (`patch_antigravity_mcp_enabled`) |
| Togglable | plugins, MCP |

## Cursor

| | |
|---|---|
| Home | `~/.cursor` (`cli-config.json`, `plugins/`, `skills/`, `skills-cursor/` = built-ins, `projects/<slug>/` = per-project CLI state, `agents/`, `plans/`) |
| CLI | **`agent`** (canonical, verified `agent --version` = `2026.08.11-…`); `cursor-agent` is the legacy alias. Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cursor-agent\{agent,cursor-agent}.cmd` (+ `.ps1`, `versions\<v>\`), installer `irm 'https://cursor.com/install?win32=true' \| iex`. Unix: `~/.local/bin/agent` → `~/.local/share/cursor-agent/versions/<v>/…`, installer `curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS \| bash`. **Name clash:** other products (Grok CLI: `~/.grok/bin/agent.exe`) also install `agent`, so `cli_locate::find_cursor_cli` only accepts an `agent` whose path (or symlink target) contains a `cursor-agent` folder, or a launcher literally named `cursor-agent`. `cursor` on PATH is the **editor**, not the CLI. |
| Plugins | `plugins/local/<name>/` (manifest directly in the folder; docs recommend a symlink to the repo) and `plugins/cache/<marketplace-name>/<plugin>/<commit-sha>/` — note the extra **version level**; older commits are kept, finished downloads carry `.cache-complete`. Adapter picks complete → highest manifest version → newest manifest. Marketplace checkouts: `plugins/marketplaces/<host>/<owner>/<repo>/<sha>/.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`. Installed/enabled state lives in the IDE's SQLite (`state.vscdb`, key `cursor.plugins.installedIds.*`, numeric marketplace ids) — not on disk in a file → plugins are listed **read-only** (`togglable: false`). |
| Skills | plugin `skills/`; user skills `~/.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; `skills-cursor/` are Cursor's managed built-ins and are skipped |
| MCP | global `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (`mcpServers`, `command/args/env` or `url/headers`), project `.cursor/mcp.json`. **Listed read-only** (`enabled: true`, `togglable: false`; `set_mcp_enabled` refuses with `cursor::MCP_READ_ONLY`, and the MCP screen shows a notice pointing to the Cursor app / `agent mcp enable|disable`). Reason (verified 2026-08-18): Cursor never reads a `disabled` key from `mcp.json` — the CLI keeps per-project lists in `~/.cursor/projects/<slug>/mcp-approvals.json` / `mcp-disabled.json`, the IDE keeps its own state — so the earlier file-patch toggle (0.1.2–0.1.3) had no effect. |
| CLI config | `~/.cursor/cli-config.json` (permissions, approval mode); `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` relocates it but **not** the per-project state under `~/.cursor/projects/`; any CLI run touches `~/.cursor/statsig-cache.json` |
| Usage / Limits | not covered (Cursor tab reads inventory only) |
| Togglable | nothing (inventory only) |

## When adding a provider

1. Add the `AgentId` variant, `binary_name`, `display_name`, home in `paths.rs`.
2. Adapter behind `AgentAdapter`; resolve the CLI via `cli_locate::resolve_provider_cli`.
3. Every write through `ConfigIo`; a regression test with a temp home (`paths::scratch_dir`) before the change.
4. Document the layout here, and mark what is verified vs assumed.
